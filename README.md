# Vanilla RichText Editor

This is a simple CMS that uses CKEditor and a custom image upload adapter

## How it works

- I used instructions found [here](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/quick-start.html) to create the editor.
- I added a 'EditorSetup' script which contains the class for the Custom-Image-Upload-Adapter.
- I then used instructions found [here](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/configuration.html#adding-features) to setup the adaptor with CKEditor.
- You can find a sample backend app to use with this [here](https://github.com/IyiKuyoro/Sample-Image-Upload-App)
